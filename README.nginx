Nginx Web Server Setup on Linux

Project Type: Linux System Administration

Author: Ishant Parashar
OS: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
Environment: Virtual Machine (Local Lab)

📌  Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to set up and configure an Nginx web server on a Linux system.
The goal was to understand how a real Linux server hosts a website and how services are managed at the system level.
The project simulates a basic production-style web server.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
Linux (Ubuntu 24.04 LTS)
Nginx Web Server
Systemd
Nano Editor
Terminal / CLI
📂 Project Structure

/var/www/
└── secure-site/
    └── index.html

/etc/nginx/
└── sites-available/
    └── secure-site
└── sites-enabled/
    └── secure-site

🔹 Step 1: Install Nginx

Installed Nginx using the package manager and verified the service status.
Copy code
Bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
Checked service status:
Copy code
Bash
sudo systemctl status nginx
✔ Nginx service started successfully.

🔹 Step 2: Create Website Directory

Created a custom directory to host the website.
Copy code
Bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/secure-site
Set ownership and permissions:
Copy code
Bash
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/secure-site
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/secure-site

🔹 Step 3: Create Web Page

Created a simple HTML page.
Copy code
Bash
nano /var/www/secure-site/index.html
Sample content:

Html
<h1>Welcome to my Nginx Web Server</h1>

🔹 Step 4: Configure Nginx Server Block

Created a custom server block configuration.
Copy code
Bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/secure-site
Configured Nginx to serve content from /var/www/secure-site.
Enabled the site:

Bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/secure-site /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
Tested configuration:
Copy code
Bash
sudo nginx -t
Restarted Nginx:
Copy code
Bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx

🔹 Step 5: Verify Website

Opened browser and accessed:
Copy code

http://localhost
✔ Custom web page displayed successfully
✔ Nginx working as expected
🧪 Troubleshooting Performed
During the project, I resolved issues such as:
404 Not Found errors
Missing directories
Incorrect file permissions
Nginx service restart failures
This helped improve my Linux debugging skills.
